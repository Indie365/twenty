The backend directory structure is as follows:

```
server
  └───ability
  └───constants 
  └───core
  └───database
  └───decorators
  └───filters
  └───guards
  └───health
  └───integrations
  └───metadata
  └───tenant
  └───utils
```

## Ability

Defines permissions and includes handlers for each entity.

## Decorators 

Defines custom decorators in NestJS for added functionality. 

See [custom decorators](https://docs.nestjs.com/custom-decorators) for more details.

## Filters

Includes exception filters to handle exceptions that might occur in GraphQL endpoints. 

## Guards

See [guards](https://docs.nestjs.com/guards) for more details. 

## Health

Includes a publicly available REST API (healthz) that returns a JSON to confirm whether the database is working as expected.

## Metadata

Defines custom objects and makes available a GraphQL API (graphql/metadata).

## Tenant

Generates and serves custom GraphQL schema based on the metadata. 

### Tenant Directory Structure 

```
tenant
  └───schema-builder
    └───factories 
    └───graphql-types
    └───database
    └───interfaces
    └───object-definitions
    └───services
    └───storage
    └───utils
  └───resolver-builder
    └───factories
    └───interfaces
  └───query-builder
    └───factories
    └───interfaces
  └───query-runner
    └───interfaces
    └───utils 
  └───utils 
  └───tenant.module.ts   
  └───tenant.service.spec.ts  
  └───tenant.service.ts      
```


The root of the tenant directory includes the `tenant.service.ts`, a file containing the `createTenantSchema` function. This function generates tenant-specific schema by using the metadata to tailor a schema for individual workspaces. By separating the schema and resolver construction, we use the `makeExecutableSchema` function, which combines these discrete elements. 

This strategy is not just about organization, but also helps with optimization, such as caching generated type definitions to enhance performance and scalability.

### Schema builder

The schema-builder generates the GraphQL schema, and includes:  

#### Factories: 

Specialised constructors to generate GraphQL-related constructs.  
- The type.factory translates field metadata into GraphQL types using `TypeMapperService`.
- The type-definition.factory creates GraphQL input or output objects derived from `objectMetadata`.

#### GraphQL Types

Includes enumerations, inputs, objects, and scalars, and serves as the building blocks for the schema construction.

#### Interfaces and Object Definitions

Contains the blueprints for GraphQL entities, and includes both predefined and custom types like `MONEY` or `URL`.

#### Services

Contains the service responsible for associating FieldMetadataType with its appropriate GraphQL scalar or query modifiers.

#### Storage 

Includes the `TypeDefinitionsStorage` class that contains reusable type definitions, preventing duplication of GraphQL types.

### Resolver Builder 

Creates resolver functions for querying and mutatating the GraphQL schema. 

#### Factories

Each factory in this directory is responsible for producing a distinct resolver type, such as the `FindManyResolverFactory`, designed for adaptable application across various tables.

### Query Builder 

Includes factories that generate `pg_graphql` queries. 

### Query Runner 

Runs the generated queries on the database and parses the result.
