# Getting started

Twenty is designed to be developer-friendly, and your local installation should be up and running in a few minutes.

In a nutshell:
- We recommend using `yarn` installation but we also provide an easy way to run the project with Docker.
- Twenty uses PostgreSQL as a database. If you don't have a PostgreSQL instance available, we also provide a one-line command to provision one through Docker.

The repository is structured as follows:
```
twenty
└───docs // contains this documentation
└───front // contains the frontend code for the application
└───server // contains the backend code for the application
└───infra // contains docker configurations for development and production deployments
```
