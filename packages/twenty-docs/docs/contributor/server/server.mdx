Twenty primarily uses NestJS for the backend. 

Prisma was the first ORM we used. But in order to allow users to create custom fields and custom objects, a lower-level made more sense as we need to have fine-grained control. The project now uses TypeORM. 

Here's what the tech stack now looks like.
