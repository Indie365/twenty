### 2. Local
If you're a developer and would like to experiment or contribute to the app, you can install Twenty on your local environment. Follow our [local setup](/developer/local-setup) guide to get started.  

### 3. Self-hosting
We provide self-hosting options if you want greater control over your data and want to run the app on your own server. Right now, Docker containers are the only hosting option we support. However we are actively working on providing simple options to self-host Twenty.
