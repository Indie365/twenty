# Folder Architecture

In this guide, you will explore the details of our project directory and how it contributes to the organization and maintainability of Twenty.

By following this folder architecture convention, it is easier to find the files related to specific features and ensure that the application is scalable and maintainable.

```

└───modules
│   └───module1
│   │   └───components
│   │   │   └───component1
│   │   │   └───component2

```

## Pages

Contains the top-level components that are defined by the application's routes. They will then be able to import more low-level components from the modules folder (more details below).

## Modules

Each module represents a self-contained functional unit of the application, comprising its specific components, states, and operational logic.

Subfolders are described in more detail below.

### Contexts

A context is a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

See [React Context](https://react.dev/reference/react#context-hooks) for more details

### States

Contains the state management logic used in the module.

See [State Management](https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory) for more details.

### GraphQL

Includes fragments, queries, and mutations.

See [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) for more details.

### Fragments

A fragment is a reusable piece of a query, which can be used in multiple places. By using fragments, it is easier to avoid duplicating code.

See [GraphQL Fragments](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments) for more details.

### Queries

See [GraphQL Queries](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/) for more details.

### Mutations

See [GraphQL Mutations](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations) for more details.

## UI

Contains all of the reusable UI components used in the application.

This folder can contain subfolders for specific types of components, such as `buttons`, `inputs`, or `modals`. Each component should be self-contained and reusable, so that it can be used in multiple parts of the application.

By separating the UI components from the other components in the `modules` folder, it is easier to maintain a consistent design and to make changes to the UI without affecting other parts of the codebase.
