To use the Rest API, you will need an API key. Connect to your Twenty account and follow this doc to get one: [how to generate your API key here.](user-guide/integrations/generating-api-keys.mdx)

## Using Postman?

You can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to interact with your Twenty objects using the API. You will need to provide your API key as a Bearer token.

## Programmatic use?

You can call the Rest API in your application using this endpoint [https://api.twenty.com](https://api.twenty.com). You will need to provide your API key as a Bearer token in your `headers.Authorization = 'Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>'`.

## Try the Rest API Playground

You can use the browser-based, interactive [Rest API playground documentation](https://docs.twenty.com/rest-api/) to Create, Read, Update or Delete your workspace objects.
